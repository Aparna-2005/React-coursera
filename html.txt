META DATA

HTML <meta> tags 
Earlier in the course, you learned about meta tags and how you can leverage them to convey information to search engines to better categorize your pages. We recommend that you keep this cheat sheet handy when building your web applications. The structure of a meta tag is as follows.

Name 
The name of the property can be anything you like, although browsers usually expect a value they understand and can take an action upon. An example would be <meta name="author" content="name"> to state the author of the page. 

Content 

The content field specifies the property's value. For example, you can use <meta name="language" content="english">, to specify the language of the webpage to search engines. 

Charset 

The charset is a special field that lets you specify the character encoding used for the page so that the browser can display it properly. The most frequently used is utf-8, and you would add it to your HTML header as follows: <meta charset="UTF-8">  

HTTP-equiv 

This field stands for HTTP equivalent, and it’s used to simulate HTTP response headers. This is rare to see, and it’s recommended to use HTTP headers over HTML http-equiv meta tags. For example, the next tag would instruct the browser to refresh the page every 30 minutes: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"> 


Basic meta tags (meta tags For SEO) 
<meta name="description"/> provides a brief description of the web page 

<meta name=”title”/> specifies the title of the web page 

<meta name="author" content="name"> specifies the author of the web page  

<meta name="language" content="english"> specifies the language of the web page 



<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" /> tells search engines how to crawl or index a certain page 

<meta name="google"/> tells Google not to show the sitelinks search box for your page when showing search results 

<meta name="googlebot" content=”notranslate” /> tells Google you don’t want to provide an automatic translation for your page if the user uses a different language  

<meta name="revised" content="Sunday, July 18th, 2010, 5:15 pm" /> specifies the last modified date and time on which you have made certain changes 

<meta name="rating" content="safe for kids"> specifies the expected audience for your page 

<meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2022"> specifies a Copyright 


<meta http-equiv="..."/> tags
 <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html"> specifies the format of the document returned by the server 

<meta http-equiv="default-style"/>  specifies the format of the styling document 

<meta http-equiv="refresh"/> specifies the duration of the page before it’s considered stale 

<meta http-equiv=”Content-language”/> specifies the language of the page 

<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache"> instructs the browser how to cache your page 

Responsive design/mobile meta tags 
<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=yes"/> indicates that telephone numbers should appear as hypertext links that can be clicked to make a phone call 

<meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="true"/> specifies that the page can be properly visualized on mobile devices 

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/> specifies the area of the window in which web content can be seen


Form and validation

        There are two methods 
             client-side validation 
                       Client-side validation checks for errors as soon as they are typed into the form. 
                       This is done by the web browser or by JavaScript code, and provide the user with immediate feedback. 
                       The client-side validation process starts by checking if a form has been filled out correctly. 
                       If there are no errors, the form will be submitted to the server for processing. 
                       However, if there are errors, an error message will alert the user of the invalid data and how to change it for successful submission
             server-side validation. 
                       server-side validation checks for errors after the data has been submitted to the web server.
                       server-side validation is more secure because it prevents malicious users from tampering with your website's code and submitting invalid data to your server.
                       When the form data is received by the web server, the backend will validate the data before processing it. 
                       This validation can run more complex checks, such as checking the data against a database, or validating the data against business requirements. 
                       Most websites use both client-side and server-side validation to provide immediate feedback to users, but also to protect against malicious data submission and to ensure data integrity.

INTERACTIVE FORM ELEMENTS

Required --> when gives in form the user cannot submit the form without filling the input 
max length --> indicates that the user can enter max value has been given
min length --> indicates that the user can enter min value has been given
multipe --> Indicates that the user can enter more than one value in a single input field.
pattern --> Defines a particular pattern that an input field value has to fulfill to be considered valid.
     ex:  <input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern=”^(?:0|\+?44)(?:\d\s?){9,10}$” >


FORM SUBMISSION
        the web browser communicates with a web server using a HTTP request
        2 methods
            POST --> more secure than get method
            GET  
                When the Login button is clicked, the form data is sent as part of the request URL. 
                This means that the user data is appended to the end of the URL in the web browser navigation bar. 
                The web server receives the HTTP GET request, and extracts the form data from the URL.
                three key problems
                        1. Lenght of the url  limited by the browser
                        2. Lenght of  the request url limited by web browser
                        3. security


SUBMIT
    
Action and method 

1. Action
      The action attribute specifies to which web address the form must be sent. 
      This is address is location of server-side code that will process the request.
       <form?action="/login"> </form> 

2. Method
     The method attribute specifies which HTTP method is used to submit the form; GET or POST. 
      <form?method="get"> </form>  // default method  --  the data in the form's fields are encoded in the URL
      <form?method="post"> </form>  -- the data is sent as part of the HTTP request body.

THE CANVAS
    GIF. WebP 2D canvas and WebGL
    The graphics interchange format or GIF along with the Web P image format are used for animated images
    The two D canvas allows two D graphics to be drawn in the web browser. It's popular for building two D video games and animations.
    The logic and behavior of an animation or video game is defined using javascript
    The benefit of WebGL is that a dedicated chip in your device called a graphics processing unit
    GPU does the calculations when graphics are rendered to the screen. This allows for complex calculations such as lighting simulation and rendering massive three D worlds
    WebGL is a complex technology and requires a lot of background information
